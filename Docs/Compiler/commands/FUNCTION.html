<h3>
FUNCTION funcName(param1 AS type, param2 AS type, ...) AS type <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{code} <br>
END FUNCTION <br>
</h3>
<br>
<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<br>
<br>
Functions are much like <a href="SUB.html">Subs</a>, with the exception that
functions return a value, whose type is specified by the <b>type</b> at the end
of the parameter list (either String or Number). A function can have any number
of parameters, each of which is specified inside the parenthesis much like a varible declaration in the <a href="VAR.html">VAR</a> command. To return a value from a function, just set the value of the variable with the same name of the function (which is
specified by <b>funcName</b>). Like subs, all variables and arrays declared within
functions can only be recognized and used within the function they are declared. Also
like subs, functions can be placed anywhere in the program code except for other
function or sub definitions.

<b><u>Usage:</u></b>
<br>
<br>
showconsole <br>
var num as number <br>
input "Enter a number: ", num <br>
print str(num) & " times 5 is " & str( <b>TimesFive(num)</b> ) <br>
<br>
<b>Function TimesFive(num As Number) As Number</b> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
var newNum as number <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
newNum = num * 5 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TimesFive = newNum  'return the new number <br>
<b>End Function</b>
