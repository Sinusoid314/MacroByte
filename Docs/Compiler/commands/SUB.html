SUB subName(param1 AS type, param2 AS type, ...) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{code} <br>
END SUB <br>
</h3>
<br>
<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<br>
<br>
Subs are blocks of code that are seperate from the rest of the program code,
and can be called from anywhere within a program using the <a href="CALL.html">
CALL</a> command. They are much like <a href="FUNCTION.html">Functions</a>, except
they do not return anything. <b>subName</b> specifies the name by which the sub will
called. A sub can have in any number of parameters, each of which is specified
after <b>subName</b> much like a varible declaration in the <a href="VAR.html">VAR</a>
command. Subs can be placed anywhere within the program code, since the compiler clips all
function and sub definitions out before running the program. The only place a sub
definition cannot be is within another sub or function definition. All variables
and arrays declared within a sub can only be used by
the <b>{code}</b> within the sub. Things such as window names and file handles
are global, and can be seen anywhere in the program code. Globally declared
variables and arrays are also recognized within all subs and functions, but are
recognized only if there is not a local variable or array of the same name. For
example, if a varaible called <b>num</b> was declared globally (not in a sub or
function), as well as in a the sub <b>GetVal</b>, the local version of <b>num</b>
(inside of <b>GetVal</b>) will be recognized instead of the global version.
