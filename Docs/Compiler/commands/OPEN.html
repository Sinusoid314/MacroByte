<h3>OPEN fileName FOR mode AS #handle</h3>
<br>
<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<br>
<br>
Opens a file specified by <b>fileName</b>. The file is given a <b>#handle</b>
to use when reading or writing to it. Close the file with the <a href="CLOSE.html">
CLOSE</a> command. There are four different <b>mode</b>s the file can be opened in:
<br>
<br>
<i>input</i> - Opens the file for reading. The file specified by <b>fileName</b>
must already exist.
<br>
<i>output</i> - Opens the file for writting to. If the file already exists, the
data in it is erased. Otherwise, a new file is created to be written to.
<br>
<i>append</i> - Opens the file for writting to, like output, but does not erase
the file's data if it already exist.
<br>
<i>binary</i> - Opens a file for both reading and writting. This mode works with the
file byte by byte, ignoring line delimiters.
